# Koa2 OracleDB app
Simple Koa 2 app with business logic stored as procedures in Oracle Database.

## Installation Guide
The guide assumes node v7+ and npm v3+ are installed as well as Oracle DB 11g XE configured, up and running.

It's better to run the app on a Unix machine.

```bash
cd $PROJECT_ROOT
npm install
node --harmony index.js
```
